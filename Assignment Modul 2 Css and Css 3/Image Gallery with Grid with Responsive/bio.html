            <p class="line1">My name is Karan and I am an portrait and wedding photographer.</p>
            <p class="line2">One of the best compliments I get from clients is that they feel like they've known me forever after a session.</p>
            <p class="line3">I have been shooting professionally for almost 3 years and my work has taken me all over the world.</p>
            <p class="line4">I have met so many incredible humans because of this career and I still cannot believe my art allows me to create family heirlooms for others.</p>
            <p class="line5">I'm so happy you are here.</p>
